# TV-script-generation
This is one of the projects in Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

I build an LSTM model and train it on 9 seasons Seinfeld TV scripts. Then the model is used to generate some new "fake" script based on some new words I provide. Although the plots might not make sense now, but you can see the model already picks up the dialogue format back and forth between the characters.
